## **1. Project Concept & Goals**

**Concept:**
A **mobile-first, one-page** interactive web app for gender reveal parties, where invited users guess the babyâ€™s gender, see live statistics, then watch the reveal â€” while their **facial expressions and voice reactions are recorded** throughout the process.

**Goals:**

* Make gender reveals more interactive and memorable.
* Capture genuine reactions with minimal setup (just a mobile browser).
* Provide shareable statistics on guesses before the reveal.
* Allow the host (admin) to download or review the recordings afterward.

---

## **2. Core Features & Requirements**

* **Unique Access Link** (sent to each guest).
* **Permission Prompt** for camera & microphone (must be accepted).
* **Guess Gender Screen** (Boy / Girl big buttons).
* **Live Statistics** showing % guesses for each gender.
* **Gender Reveal Animation** (e.g., pink or blue confetti).
* **Reaction Capture**:

  * Record **face (webcam)** and **voice (mic)** from the moment the app loads until reveal ends.
  * Store recording securely.
* **Admin Dashboard**:

  * View/download all recordings.
  * See guess statistics.
